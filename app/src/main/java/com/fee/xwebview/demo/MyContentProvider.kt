     * You should defer nontrivial initialization (such as opening,

     * disk) from halting application launch.

     * If you use SQLite, [android.database.sqlite.SQLiteOpenHelper]
     * is a helpful utility class that makes it easy to manage databases,

     * that _id value.
     * @param projection The list of columns to put into the cursor. If
     * `null` all columns are included.
